About: 
This is a text editor resembling the vi editor but with limited feature set.

Argument:
"filename.txt"
If it already exists, it is opened in the editor.
If not, it is created and opened for editing.

Input type text:
The sentences in the file should be separated by '\n'.
Vertical and horizontal scrolling have not been implemented. So for proper functioning of code provide an input file of screen size.
